											<h3>Introduction</h3>
											<p>The primary objective of this project was to develop a freely accessible program that not only harnessed the power of AI technology but also demonstrated its efficacy in enhancing our lives with accuracy, speed, and efficiency. With a specific focus on snake identification, the project aimed to showcase how AI can be leveraged to address a critical issue in South Africa, where snakebite-related deaths claim the lives of thousands of individuals annually. By creating a program powered by Microsoft Azure's Cognitive AI services, the project sought to provide a tangible solution that not only accurately identified snake species but also prevented the misidentification of harmless snakes. Through this endeavor, the transformative potential of AI technology in saving lives and improving our understanding of the natural world was to be showcased.</p>

										<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
										<p>Snakebite-related deaths pose a significant problem in Africa, claiming the lives of approximately 20,000 individuals each year. Despite the availability of antivenom and advanced medical treatments, accurately identifying the snake responsible for the bite remains a rare skill possessed by only a few individuals worldwide. In order to address this critical issue, I undertook a project utilizing Microsoft Azure's Cognitive AI services to develop a program.</h3>
										<p>The primary objective of this initiative was not solely to correctly identify snake species, but also to prevent the misidentification of harmless snakes. It is worth noting that numerous snakes across the globe are needlessly killed due to being mistaken for poisonous species. Through the implementation of my freely accessible program, accurate snake identification becomes possible, thereby reducing fatalities among both human beings and reptilian populations.</p>

										<h3>Solution</h3>	
											<li>Data Collection: High-quality images of South Africa's most venomous snakes were sourced from reliable and diverse sources.</li>
											<li>Data Preprocessing: The collected images underwent preprocessing to ensure compatibility and consistency.
												Images were resized, normalized, and standardized to facilitate efficient training and reduce bias.
												Any noise or artifacts present in the images were removed to improve the quality of the dataset.</li>
											<li>Training Setup: The Azure Cognitive AI services, such as Azure Custom Vision or Azure Machine Learning, were utilized for training the model.
												The training setup involved configuring the AI services with the necessary parameters and specifications.
												The selected AI services were trained on the preprocessed dataset, allowing the model to learn patterns and features of different snake species.</li>
											<li>Model Training: The training process involved feeding the dataset to the AI services, which leveraged machine learning algorithms.
												The model iteratively analyzed and learned from the images, extracting relevant features for snake identification.
												Training iterations were performed to optimize the model's accuracy and performance, adjusting hyperparameters as needed.</li>
											<li>Model Evaluation: The trained model was evaluated using a separate validation dataset to assess its performance and generalization capabilities.
												Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were computed to measure the model's effectiveness.
												The model was refined and fine-tuned based on the evaluation results, ensuring improved performance and reducing misclassifications.</li>
											<li>Integration and Deployment: The trained model was integrated into the snake identification program, utilizing the capabilities of Microsoft Azure's Cognitive AI services.
												The program's user interface was developed to allow users to interact with the model and input images for snake identification.
												The program was deployed on a suitable platform, such as a web application or a mobile application, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.</li>
